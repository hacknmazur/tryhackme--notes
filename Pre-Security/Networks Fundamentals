## üì° Network Fundamentals

### IP Addressing

- An **IP address** is a set of four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- Devices can have **public** or **private** IP addresses.
- **Private IP ranges** include:
  - 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255
- Public IP addresses are routable on the internet, while private IPs are used inside local networks.

### MAC Address

- MAC (Media Access Control) address is a **unique 12-digit hexadecimal number** separated by colons (e.g., `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`).
- The first 6 digits identify the manufacturer, the last 6 are unique per device.

## üñ•Ô∏è OSI Model & Protocols

### OSI Model Layers (7 layers)

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data with protocol information at each layer.

### Routing Protocols on Layer 3 (Network Layer)

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** ‚Äî link-state routing protocol.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** ‚Äî distance-vector routing protocol.

## üß© Packet and Frame Structure

- A **packet** consists of:
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Time To Live (TTL)
  - Checksum (for error-checking)
  - Payload data
- A **frame** contains physical addressing (MAC addresses) and packet data.

## üîó TCP/IP Model & Packet Details

- TCP/IP model has 4 layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application.
  
### TCP Packet Structure:

| Field            | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Source Port      | Randomly selected port from available ports (0‚Äì65535) |
| Destination Port | Port where the receiving service listens (e.g., 80 for HTTP) |
| Source IP Address | IP address of the sender device                      |
| Destination IP Address | IP address of the receiving device               |
| Sequence Number  | Number assigned to order TCP segments                |
| Acknowledgment Number | Next expected sequence number                      |
| Checksum        | Ensures data integrity                                |
| Flags           | Controls connection state (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)      |
| Data            | Actual payload                                        |

### TCP Connection Establishment and Termination

- **Three-way handshake**:
  1. SYN (synchronize)
  2. SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge)
  3. ACK (acknowledge)
  
- **Connection termination**:
  1. FIN
  2. ACK/FIN
  3. ACK

## üß™ UDP Protocol and Packet Structure

| Field            | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| TTL              | Time to Live, prevents packet looping                |
| Source IP Address | Sender's IP address                                  |
| Destination IP Address | Receiver's IP address                              |
| Source Port      | Randomly selected port                               |
| Destination Port | Port of the service                                  |
| Data             | Payload data                                        |

## üîå Common Network Ports

| Service | Port Number |
|---------|-------------|
| FTP     | 21          |
| SSH     | 22          |
| HTTP    | 80          |
| HTTPS   | 443         |
| RDP     | 3389        |
| SMB     | 445         |

## üåê Advanced Networking Concepts

### Intranet and Extranet

- **Intranet** ‚Äî private internal network within an organization.
- **Extranet** ‚Äî a controlled private network allowing access to outsiders (partners, vendors).

### Port Forwarding

- Technique to redirect communication requests from one address/port to another.

### Firewalls

- **Stateful Firewall** ‚Äî monitors active connections and makes filtering decisions based on connection state.
- **Stateless Firewall** ‚Äî filters packets based only on static information like IP address and port.

## üîí VPN Basics and Protocols

### What is VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, allowing users to send and receive data securely.

### VPN Protocols:

#### PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
- Used historically for direct connections over phone lines.
- Provides framing and basic authentication but **no strong encryption**.
- Mostly outdated.

#### PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)
- VPN protocol that encapsulates PPP packets inside IP packets.
- Uses TCP port 1723 and GRE protocol.
- Considered insecure and deprecated.

#### IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)
- Provides authentication and encryption at the IP packet level.
- Has two modes:
  - Transport mode (encrypts payload only)
  - Tunnel mode (encrypts entire packet)
- Widely used for secure VPNs.

## üñß VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

- Logical segmentation of a physical network into multiple broadcast domains.
- Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly without routing.
- Improves security and network efficiency by isolating traffic.
- VLAN tagging (802.1Q) marks packets to belong to specific VLANs.
